# Macro-Pad
This project was inspired by the ocreeb-12 project <a href='https://github.com/sb-ocr/ocreeb-12'>here</a>.  A big part of this project for me was ordering my first custom PCB.  All my other projects so far have been soldered breadboards.  It took some time to learn, but this process makes the final circuit so much easier to work with.   
PCB files were created using EagleCad.  I used Solidworks to create the STL models for printing.  

BOM for the project:
<ul>
  <li>KB2040 board - 1
  <li>1N4148W Diode - 12
  <li>Cherry MX Mechanical Keys - 12
  <li>MX Key Caps - 12
  <li>Neopixel 5050 LEDs - 4
  <li>Custom PCB - 1
  <li>Encoder - 2
  <li>Rubber Feet - 4
  <li>10 kOhm Resistor - 1
  <li>0.1 uF capacitor - 4
</ul>

STL files can be found on my printables page, <a href=''>here</a>.
